      <h2>What the project will do</h2>
      <p>Upon successful completion of the mobile application it will fast become the number one travel application for public transport in Victoria. By this time the application will have gone through rigorous testing to ensure it will be able to handle many users, their information and give them the best possible user experience. Ideally the application will attract a partnership with public transport operators in Victoria as it will be the best for them in regards for promoting and using their product. This could lead to further projects with possibilities to collaborate with the Victorian government, Metro/Country trains or Yarra Trams. Also, this will allow for better integration of software on the application working with payments and ticketing for public transport and other outside systems. This application will assist with journey planning incorporating disruptions, ticketing and we will test and incorporate what users want for additional features. The project will take the best parts of PTV and Myki and their competing apps with a user focus to improve on what they want and solving their problems. This could be features for the elderly to assist with not getting lost, calendar synchronisation for working professionals and friend locations for millennials.
      </p>
      <p>It is assumed that the project will be programmed and built using Android Studio 4.0 as the application is planned to release on android devices initially due to their ease of access and ability to test. It also minimises the need for a software license in that regard, however if we wish to publish our application on the google play store or other android variants, we may require the use of Google play’s app licensing feature. </p>
      <p>The hardware needed will include an android compatible device (for the first release of the application) which has Near-Field Communication hardware within it, this is just a small NFC chip that is most likely already installed in most modern smart devices.</p>
    </br>
    <h2>How we will do it </h2>
    <p>We have a 12-step plan to fully explore, test, research and market the mobile application. For the scope of this project in 4 weeks, we will only be completing step 1 and exploring some parts of step 2. Daily meetings will be held after the initial 4 weeks during the working week to incorporate Agile project management to keep everything transparent and all project members informed of actions being taken and tasks completed.</p>
    <p>Over 10 weeks afterwards, if we were going ahead, we would be completing step 2,3 and possibly near the end start on step 4 and creating a prototype.</p>
    <p>A project of this magnitude would likely take around 6 months or longer as it’s a large project with many skills, technical knowledge and investment required. As we progress through the steps, we would need to either upskill ourselves quickly or bring in professionals who we would likely need to pay. This means that we would need to seek investment between steps 5-8. There are already other mobile transport applications so it’s important to make sure the user experience is optimal and that the product is only released to market when it will definitely be an improvement on competing applications. Otherwise it will likely not be reviewed favourably and would not create the kind of buzz and positive first impression needed to grow in the crowded mobile application marketplace.</p>
  </br>
  <p>Step 1 – Define goal for app, problem its solving.</p>
  <p>The goal for this app is to become the number 1 used public transport companion application. It looks to solve the problem of clunky mobile transport applications and streamline payments, ticketing and journey planning.</p>
  <p>Step 2 – Sketch app, storyboard key journeys and uses/features of app</p>
  <p>Step 3 – Research feasibility, viability. Monetization and marketing of app. Privacy issues, costs, legal requirements etc. How will the app make money? Download cost? Free download with ads?</p>
  <p>Step 4 – Prototype of app, clearer road mapping introducing changes from step 3.</p>
  <p>Step 5 – Back end of app, servers required, what limitations may there be and how can we scale up if needed?</p>
  <p>Step 6 – Test Prototype. Test with users, users are anyone using PTV (public transport Victoria) need to test with a range of demographics and technical expertise. Get feedback.</p>
  <p>Step 7 – Incorporate Analytics and metrics in app to monitor user behaviour.</p>
  <p>Step 8 – Test again, using the analytics and metrics see if the app and users are using as per feedback and is the app meeting its goal?</p>
  <p>Step 9 – Incorporate relevant feedback, finish minor details and release first version of live app.</p>
  <p>Step 10 – Test live, are metrics being captured accurately? Are users able to complete desired actions?</p>
  <p>Step 11- Upgrade app with improvements or new features from feedback, live metrics, analytics.</p>
  <p>Step 12 – Market app to users.</p>
</br>
<h2>Steps we will take</h2>
<p>In these first four weeks, we will be largely planning the project and sorting out the various aims, roles, scope, limits, tool, technologies, testing, risks, skills and process and communications for the project. We need to work these out in collaboration with each other so we are able to make sure we are making this application better and with a point of difference to our competitors. Additionally, by understanding these details, we will be able to continue the project if group members drop out and/or if we need to incorporate new people into the project as it would progress beyond the initial four weeks. There are many details that need to be worked out, discussed, tested, budgeted etc. Because of this, we will need to practice Agile project management. Agile project management focuses on customer satisfaction, continuous adaptation, testing early and often, collaboration, transparency and going one step at a time. What this means in terms of the timeline is that it is expected to change and be responsive to results, discussions and collaboration between project members. So the specific tasks we have planned can always change, being brought forward or moved back to accommodate the evolving nature of the project.</p>
</br>
<h2>Roles</h2>
<p>There are no specific roles in the WIP group because we use the strengths and weaknesses of the group to allocate specific tasks, so we can get the project done efficiently with high quality of input of work. However, if a group member does struggle with a specific task then they are able to message the group chat for help and learn from the other members who are strong in this field as well. The allocated tasks is Dylan doing team profiles, and tools and technologies, because he has background knowledge of the tools and technologies of what is needed for the designed product as well as he has put together the team profile for the WIP group before, which he would be able to assemble the group profiles efficiently. Mark has been allocated to timeframe, and plans and progress as he has the ability to write in great detail without any unnecessary comments, he also has very good time management and therefore could help the group plan for the required outcomes needed for this project for each week. Scopes and Limits has been designated to Sadhav as he has good analytical skills which means that he would be able to determine whether the deliverables would be viable or would have to be altered in order to make it viable. Zhengchao has been assigned to testing because of his creativity and communication traits, which the creative side would assist him to think of different ways of testing to gather information and his communication traits would help to communicate to the participants who are testing the product. Densel has been allocated to risks because he is an ability to analyse situations easily and determine whether a risk would arise from the situation thus helping to provide solutions to overcome the risks. Darien has been assigned to roles because his openness allows to see why each member was assigned to each task therefore being able to easily justify why each people chose that task.
</p>

<h2>Scope and Limits</h2>
<p>It is important to plan for a project like this to utilise the time and other resources properly. While the development of this mobile application, the initial step will be to develop the application which is different to the current transport application. This will resolve all the issues people are facing using the current application. WIP Group can also survey various groups of people to get a better understanding of what they are struggling with and what they expect from their public transport application. This will help to achieve the goal of being the number 1 used public transport companion application. Then the features will be discussed which are not available in the current application and are to be introduced in the application developed by WIP group. Once all the features and issues are listed, then we can start on how our application will look. This will be the focus for the first 4 weeks. Thereafter we would need various professionals who will help us in the development of the application which include a Ui designer, Android Development Engineer, iOS Development Engineer, Server Development Engineer and Testing Engineer. Once the application is developed, it will need to be tested. Testing will be done by surveying large groups of people and taking feedbacks from them as we do not have a prototype. We need to plan the later stages according to the availability of funds because we will need technology and tools such as special software with license, computers or laptops with high efficiency and workspace. These will also act the limitations to our project as we cannot work on the application until we have enough investment to fund our project. We will also need to be upskilled to develop the application and need funds to hire the professionals. The application cannot be developed on general software as the application will be used by the public, so it needs to be exclusive and refined. This will require appropriate tools and technology which will be expensive. Initially, we will focus on the Victoria, if everything goes alright and the response to the application is positive, we can expand the application to other states of Australia. We can publish the application first on one platform, either Android or iOS and observe the response of the public. If the application is successful, we can publish it on more platforms which will help us to cut down the costs. The earlier stages of the application will only include certain features such as journey planning, incorporating disruptions, ticketing. After a certain stage, the application will be updated with features like elderly to assist with not getting lost, calendar synchronisation for working professionals and friend locations for millennials to give a competitive advantage with the present application.
</p>
</br>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>According to our plan, the whole project process will involve three test stages, including user requirements test in the early stage of the project, black box and white box technology test in the development process, and a small range of user prototype test.</p>

<p>In the first four weeks of the project, we focused on user requirements testing. Because it is very important to understand the user's function in our project. What types of public transport supporting applications do they expect? Can the ticketing mode without card realize more convenient interactive experience? Do the elderly, children and special groups have equal access to our services? And whether the user's mobile phone can generally realize the digital daily public transport function and so on. We will randomly look for users taking public transport and invite them to participate in our pre prepared questionnaire. 100 users of different ages can provide us with correct and meaningful data. Once we have identified the strengths and weaknesses of the project and the level of user acceptance of the functionality provided in the application. We can move on to the next phase of prototyping and more testing.</p>

<p>When the project is implemented to the middle stage (when we have completed the main construction and some functions of the software), the black box test will be the first test after coding, because it is conducted from the perspective of users according to the corresponding relationship between input data and output data. It tests each function for proper operation. In the test, as a box that can't be opened, the program only checks whether the function of the program is in normal use in the test program interface regardless of the internal structure and internal characteristics under the condition of the program. According to the terms of the requirements and specifications, the program can correctly receive the input data and generate the correct output information. Black box testing focuses on the external structure of the program without considering the internal logic structure. It mainly tests the software interface and software functions. By performing this test, we do not need to understand the internal structure of the program code to fully simulate the use of the software by the end user of the software product, and check whether the software product meets the needs of the user. It can check the realization of the functional requirements of the tested system better and more truly from the perspective of users. After checking the input and output of items with black box test, you can use white box test to test the internal coding part.</p>

<p>White box testing is the opposite of black box testing, focusing on the code itself. Through static analysis and dynamic analysis, it points out whether the representation and description of software are consistent, conflicting or fuzzy, and analyzes the behavior of software system before, during and after the execution of software system in simulated or real environment. By checking the internal logical structure of the software, we can cover the logical path in the software. Checkpoints are set at various points of the program to check the state of the program to determine whether the actual running state is consistent with the expected state. By performing white box tests, we can optimize our software as we examine each branch and path in our code. However, it will also cost us expensive money and resources, because too many things / logic need to be checked in the code. But white box testing is a necessary way to optimize our software.</p>

<p>Finally, we plan to invite a small number of users for internal testing when the application is initially completed. Users use our application to ride the public transport system to evaluate the functions we provide. When we get user feedback, we optimize the application and test it again to determine whether the application reaches the goal.</p>
<p>Overall, doing well in these three phases of testing will be very helpful to our application. In addition, we should continue to track application reviews and improve application availability and functionality based on user needs.</p>

</br>
<h2>Risks</h2>
<p>The potential risk that was able to be identified in our public transport companion application is the use of our software, the ability to combine cards into our application and the possibility of users feeling that their application is similar to other apps. Due to having our application being available for android users we have chosen the software android studios to develop the app, which has created potential risks when developing the application because it has a history of being difficult to learn which can cause difficulties when trying to make an app to the best of its capabilities, furthermore has also being known to be inconsistent due to being slow and the constant need of updating makes it difficult to work with. The main risk for our public transport companion application would be ensuring that users do not view it as being similar or the same as PTV or Myki mobile services but instead something bigger and greater than those applications which users are able to view as a better and different version.
</p>
<p>Additionally, there are also other major risks that can take place when developing the app and one of them is being able to identify the right type of personnel to effectively contribute in making the app. For example, when implementing the technology, it is important to ensure the individual can properly handle the technology being used, to ensure that the money being provided to us is not going to waste and is able to be facilitated to other areas of the mobile development, ultimately leading to a negative reputation and potentially cause less money to be invested into the public transport companion application. This could halt the development of the mobile application and can result in the app not being the best version it can be as it is not getting the optimal resources and support needed to create the application.</p>
