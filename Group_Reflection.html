      <h2>Group Reflection</h2>

        <h3>Mark</h3>
        <h4>What went well</h4>
        <p>Early on we successfully incorporated our new members and delegated tasks allowing work to be done without having to get 6 people to agree on meeting times all who have different schedules. We divided up tasks well. Group members choose task they were comfortable doing, playing to their strengths. While we could have communicated more regularly, when we did it was good communication, respectful, and productive</p>
        <h4>What could be improved</h4>
        <p>Meeting more regularly could be improved. Possibly having some meetings with a few group members and then sharing the discussion and agenda with the group. Everyone may have a different visions for a project or see it differently due to their background, culturally or through experience meeting a bit more would have made it easier to all get on the same page.</p>
        <h4>At least one thing that was surprising </h4>
        <p>I was very happily surprised with the contribution of Zhenchao Sun. Additionally, a few members of the group reached out for help and happily took feedback which was very mature and will serve them well with their studies.</p>
        <h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</h4>
        <p>I donâ€™t think I really learned too much; this is my last semester at RMIT. What went well, what could be improved I expected. It was nice to be surprised positively but there is always a surprise.</p>

        <h3>Darien</h3>
        <h4>What went well</h4>
        <p>Everyone doing their part of work as well as random group check up to see how everyone is going</p>
        <h4>What could be improved</h4>
        <p>More regular meetings than just spontaneous meetings</p>
        <h4>At least one thing that was surprising </h4>
        <p>Everyone was able to complete their parts on time</p>
        <h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</h4>
        <p>Having an organised group is very difficult to obtain</p>

        <h3>Dylan</h3>
        <h4>What went well</h4>
        <p>Our team managed to successfully work together with the addition of new members, as</p>

        <h3>Zhengchao</h3>
        <h4>What went well</h4>
        <p>Because Densel and I are midway into the WIP group, we are not familiar with the previous project content. But all the members of the team are very good, quickly accepted us, and can quickly integrate into the cooperation. At the same time, it is also clear about their cooperation mode. Everyone focuses on the areas they are good at. For example, Dylan is familiar with web design and GitHub, Mark is understanding of content is more accurate, and so on. All these help Densel and I quickly integrate into the team. And with their help, I finished the content of testing very well.</p>
        <h4>What could be improved</h4>
        <p>English is my second language, and I am lack of oral expression. This led to my communication with the team not so smooth. So I am also actively learning English to improve communication efficiency.</p>
        <h4>At least one thing that was surprising </h4>
        <p>The project content of WIP group is the most surprising for me, because this is my first day in Melbourne. The public transport in Melbourne is very good. It's efficient and free in the main areas. But it's not convenient to use mobile phone to swipe card. Because I was in Beijing before, bus and subway can use mobile phone to swipe card. I think Melbourne can try it, too.</p>
        <h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</h4>
        <p>Full communication is one of the best ways to achieve work efficiency. It helps me a lot.</p>

        <h3>Densel</h3>
        <h4>What went well</h4>
        <p>Considering that I had just joined WIP group and was not familiar with the project content like the other members in the group. I believe that a lot of things went well in the group as they had accepted me from the start and had allowed me the time to understand the project more, during our group meetings as well as the detailed project information from assignment 2. However being in a well-functioning group had taken pressure off me as the work demand was not as high as it was in the previous group, this was because we had given each member a task to achieve and everyone was able to successfully achieve the task given</p>
        <h4>What could be improved</h4>
        <p>The main thing that could be improved would be my knowledge in IT as I felt that I could have done a better job in writing the answers for the project if I had a higher level of knowledge. Another thing I would like to improve would be my confidence around new people.</p>
        <h4>At least one thing that was surprising </h4>
        <p>The most surprising thing that I had found would have been the project content that WIP group had, it was very detailed, easy to understand and contributed to me being able to help the group.</p>
        <h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</h4>
        <p>Being in a functional group allows for a lot of good communication and enables everyone to work efficiently. It had helped me a lot as I was able to get feedback and try to improve my answers.</p>

        <h3>Sadhav</h3>
        <h4>What went well</h4>
        <p>In this assignment, 2 more people were added to the group which made a total of 6 members in the group. Less tasks were allocated to everyone because there were more members in the group now which reduced the workload from each of the group member.</p>
        <h4>What could be improved</h4>
        <p>Some of the group members did not attend meetings which created an issue of communication. This could be improved, and the group could work more efficiently. Some of the group members did not respond to the messages in the Facebook group which was a bit disappointing.</p>
        <h4>At least one thing that was surprising </h4>
        <p>Everyone was able to finish their allocated tasks in time without communicating in the Facebook group was surprising,</p>
        <h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</h4>
        <p>I learnt that face-to-face classes are a lot better than virtual classes. This assignment would have done in better way if we did not have the online classes.</p>
