      <h2>Skills & Jobs</h2>
      <p>First, it is a great honor to recognize our project. If I can get financial support, I will hire professionals with different skills for the next phase of the application. The requirements are as follows:</p>
      <p>I can be competent for the responsibilities of product manager and project manager. I am responsible for controlling the project process, designing various functions of software, etc. In addition, we need a UI designer, an IOS development engineer, an Android Development Engineer, a server development engineer and an operation and test engineer. There are six people including me.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ui designer, responsible for the design of front-end UI</li>
        <li>IOS development engineer, responsible for the development of IOS client</li>
        <li>Android Development Engineer, responsible for the development of Android client</li>
        <li>Server development engineer, responsible for the development of the server</li>
        <li>Operation and testing engineer, responsible for the operation and maintenance of the application, and software testing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition to the above required professional technical ability, all people need some work experience, preferably with the experience of executing related projects. In addition, all people need to have good teamwork ability, communication ability, execution ability and excellent creativity. I think creativity is one of the important factors to distinguish a good employee.</p>
      <p>Finally, I also believe that full stack talents will be the future trend. Every employee needs to be able to solve problems that arise during the national process of application development. This requires us to build a solid foundation in different fields.</p>
