  <p>My name is Densel Jharvis Hashim or as some teachers may know me as s3840346. I am an Australian citizen with a Turkish and Philippines background, however I speak English at home due to only knowing a few words in those respective languages. I attended Lynbrook Primary School and moved to Narre Warren South P-12 College in the 7th grade where I would end up choosing the VCE pathway as I believed it was the most appropriate path for me to take throughout my final years of schooling in which I am now studying Bachelor of Information Technology at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT).</p>
  <p>My main hobby would be that I am a sport fanatic as I tend to watch a lot of main sports especially football or as many in Australia know it as soccer which makes me to wake up at different times due to me being a passionate Liverpool supporter as I grew up barracking for them throughout my life and usually requires me to wake up early or stay up late so I am able to watch them take to the field each week.</p>

  <h3>Discussing Group Processes</h3>
  <p>With regards to assignment 2, our groups was able to work functionally despite shortcomings involving mismanagement of time and a late start. In terms of member relations, our team was able to resolve problems in a civil manner and there was little to no negativity towards each other.</p>
  <p>Assignment 3 comes with the addition of 2 new members to the WIPGroup, Densel and Zhenchao. With the addition of these new members the way we operate and plan our work has slightly changed, as well as general improvements we hope to keep implemented such as regular communication and recorded meetings.</p>


  <h3>Discussing Our Ideal Jobs</h3>
  <p>It's interesting to see that each member has their own variant of a dream job, each with some variation, they are as follows:</p>
  <p>Mark: Senior Business Analyst</p>
  <p>Dylan: Software Engineer</p>
  <p>Sadhav: Systems Accountant</p>
  <p>Darien: Cyber Security Specialist</p>
  <p>Densel: Information Technology Teacher</p>
  <p>Mark is a bit of an outlier when it comes to the the overall dream job list of our group as his job branches out into the business side of information management as an analyst, although Sadhav is in a similar postition with an interest in systems accounting placing him in the middle with aspects of both information technology and business</p>
  <p>Darien and Dylan have the more technologically appealing jobs with software engineers directing towards the aspect of programming and coding, while cyber security specialist understand code but only as a side focus, mainly appealing to the networking side of information technology.</p>
  <p>However, the addition of Densel to the group adds another member who aspires to join the field of Information Technology as a teacher, which requires a deep understanding of all aspects of Information Technology</p>
