      <h2>Group Processes and Communications</h2>
      <p>For communication and discussion, we have set up a Facebook group and an MS Teams group, allowing us to share files, give feedback, discuss the project and hold meetings. Having meetings was set for after our Wednesdays tutorialwith Trevor. Since we had 6group members it was difficult to set hard and fast rulesor processesas we all have outside commitments and different work, study loads. Some team members had some personal things as well. We havean understanding for everyone to contribute and get thisproject done as best we can. Early on we delegatedall tasks, allowingteam members to share theirwork and getfeedbackoutside of meetings.This may lack transparency on Github trails of work contributed to the project, however, not all members have thesame skills. The Facebook group and MS teams group will show all members contribution and activity. Minimum frequency of communication wasexpected to be at least once a week. </p>
      <p>If continuing with this project, as the semester would be finished a much higher level of communication would be expected. This would be everyday at least briefly, to keep in line with our goals and using Agile project management so all team members are informed and heading down the same path.</p>
